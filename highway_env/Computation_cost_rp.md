After testing different delay values (ranging from 0s to 2s) in the highway-v0 environment using my trained TD3 model, I observed a notable reduction in reward as computation cost increased. This suggests that longer decision-making delays negatively impact the agentâ€™s ability to navigate effectively, leading to suboptimal performance.
